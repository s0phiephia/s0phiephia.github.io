<h1>You Chose: Long scenic route.</h1>

<p>You decide to take the long scenic route to work today. You pull out of your driveway and begin the drive. You go through backroads and appreciate the beauty of the trees and nature surrounding you. Your windows are open to get some of that fresh air. Everything just feels so nice.</p>

<p>All of a sudden your car starts to make a noise that it shouldn't be making. You begin to get concerned and grab your phone to call a friend just in case anything happens. Your mood quickly changes when you realize that you are still in the part of the drive with no service. Your car comes to a stop as you pull off to the side in hopes someone may stop to help you. </p>

<p>You begin to feel a whole lot less alone, but in a bit of a creepy way, when you realize how many animals must be in the woods around you. You continue to check your phone in hopes a message will go out or come through. Maybe you won't be on time to work like you had thought. You start walking away from your car and towards work to try and get some service when you make a little friend flying around you.</p>

<p>It's a little birdy and you smile at the thought of a companion. I mean, what harm could a little bird do anyways? You stop to say hi and smile a little before continuing on your search for service. The bird keeps getting closer and closer, and more of them start to appear. </p>

<p>Next thing you know, there are so many birds that you can no longer see the sky. You feel panicked and claustrophobic as they swarm. You black out. </p>

<p>You awake in a government facility. The birds took you hostage and you never made it to work. This is when you remembered... Birds Aren't Real.</p>
