<h1>You Chose: Short route.</h1>

<p>You decide to take the short route to work. You get there early and hang out with your co-workers for a while. </p>

<p>The day goes by seemingly normal. However, as soon as you are getting ready to leave you notice something. It's that bird from earlier! How did it know where you were? Is there something that it wants from you? You begin to tell a co worker about your experience with the bird. They reassure you it's most likely not the same bird. I mean, all birds look the same anyways, right?</p>

<p>You head out to your car to go home, without ever taking your eyes off of the bird.</p>

<p>You make it home and turn on the tv. It's on the news. They are talking about some crazy conspiracy... it says "Birds Aren't Real." You turn to the window and lock eyes with the bird one last time. I don't think it likes the fact that you caught on so quickly. </p>
