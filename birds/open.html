<h1>You Chose: Open blinds.</h1>

<p>You leave the blinds open in order to let in the sunshine. It seems like it is going to be a beautiful day. You grab your coffee and sit by the window when you notice there is a bird sitting in the tree right outside. You don't think much of it and continue on with your day.</p>
