<h1>You Chose: Short route.</h1>

<p>You decide to take the short route to work. You get there early and hang out with your co-workers for a while. </p>

<p>The day goes by far too normally. You finish your shift and contemplate going out for drinks with friends before going home. You decide against it as you are feeling quite tired and worn down from a long repetitive day anyways.</p>

<p>You make it home safe and sound. You turn on the tv. It's the news. They are saying something about some crazy new conspiracy. Did I hear that right? Did they just say that Birds Aren't Real?</p>
