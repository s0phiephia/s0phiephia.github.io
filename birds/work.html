<h1>You leave for work.</h1>

<p>As you are walking out to your car you notice that same bird that you noticed from the window. Again, you choose to disregard it and continue on with your day. You are running early for work. Do you decide to take the longer, more scenic route, and get to work perfectly on time? Or do you take the shorter, normal, path to work and get there early? </p>
